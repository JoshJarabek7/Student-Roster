# Student-Roster
Created a Student Roster program written in C++ for my Scripting and Programming course at WGU. 

Scenario:

You are hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. Since the application already exists, its requirements exist as well, and they are outlined in the next section. You are responsible for implementing the part of the system based on these requirements. A list of data is provided as part of these requirements. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data.

You must write a program containing two classes (i.e., Student and Roster). The program will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. This information can be found in the “studentData Table” below. The program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students called classRosterArray. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.




Requirements/Rubric:


  1. Introduction to Programming: The graduate applies fundamental programming concepts in a specific programming environment.
    
  2. Variables and Data Types: The graduate prepares code which declares, initializes, and assigns values to variables of appropriate types as part of the application development process.
    
  3. Control Structures: The graduate writes code that implements decision and loop constructs to control the flow of a program.
    
  4. Arrays: The graduate creates arrays in order to solve complex problems.
    
  5. Pointers and Memory: The graduate applies pointers to solve complex problems.
    
  6. Functions: The graduate writes code that creates and manipulates functions and files.
    
  7. Object-Oriented Paradigm: The graduate applies object-oriented programming concepts in order to create a basic application.
